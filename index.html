	      <div class="bodyparagraph">Residents of Africa, especially native peoples, have very low incomes. This means that, among other issues, they have trouble getting
 good-quality medical care. However, new hospitals and medical buildings are being built to service their needs. These hospitals are short on staff. That's where we come in. Our trip will visit rural Tanzania to work in 
 hospitals. Diseases like malaeria, HIV/AIDS, and others are a major concern. With these new hospitals, we can save the lives of millions.</div>
	      
	      <h class="bodyheader">Accomodations</h>
	      <div class="bodyparagraph">When we arrive in Dar es Salaam, we will head from the airport to the Blue Pearl Hotel. It is a nice hotel, but definitely not the most expensive in the city. It will probably be the nicest accommodations during the entire trip. $60 for one night for a room. 


Next, as we move along, weâ€™ll stay at the Mvuli hotel in Arusha. It costs less per night, and provides more basic accommodations, but it is still comfortable. It costs $53 per room per night.
