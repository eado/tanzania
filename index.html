        <h class="bodyheader">How can we help?</h>
	      <div class="bodyparagraph">Residents of Africa, especially native peoples, have very low incomes. This means that, among other issues, they have trouble getting
 good-quality medical care. However, new hospitals and medical buildings are being built to service their needs. These hospitals are short on staff. That's where we come in. Our trip will visit rural Tanzania to work in 
 hospitals. Diseases like malaeria, HIV/AIDS, and others are a major concern. With these new hospitals, we can save the lives of millions.</div>
	      <h class="bodyheader">Transportation</h>
	      <div class="bodyparagraph"><p>For our transportation needs, we chose Delta Airlines. We depart March 26 at 5:09 AM from Minneapolis to Amsterdam. After that, there is a layover of 2 hours and 5 minutes. Then, we depart from Amsterdam at 10:35 am, and arrive at 8:10 pm at Mount Kilimanjaro, Tanzania. After that, we have another flight, after 55 minutes of layover, to Dar es Salaam. All of this costs 1,255 USD per person.



<br/><br/>
Once we arrive in Tanzania, we will hire a rental car. After we arrive in Arusha, we will need to hire a driver who knows his way around the area. There are lots of dirt roads and it can be difficult to navigate. Also, a driver would be helpful because the native people aren’t always as friendly as you might expect, and having someone who speaks their language would be nice. 

<br/><br/>
We’d have this driver drive us the 15 miles or so from Arusha to one of the tribe hospitals. We would head there and come back every day. Arusha has grocery stores and all of the usual small-town accommodations that we might find ourselves needing. 

<br/><br/>
For our return flight, we depart from Dar es Salaam on April 10 at 11:20 PM and arrive at Amsterdam at 7:40 PM. We have a 5 hour and 20 minute layover, then have another flight to Minneapolis, which we arrive at 3:08 PM.

	      <h class="bodyheader">Accomodations</h>
	      <div class="bodyparagraph">When we arrive in Dar es Salaam, we will head from the airport to the Blue Pearl Hotel. It is a nice hotel, but definitely not the most expensive in the city. It will probably be the nicest accommodations during the entire trip. $60 for one night for a room. 

<br/><br/>
Next, as we move along, we’ll stay at the Mvuli hotel in Arusha. It costs less per night, and provides more basic accommodations, but it is still comfortable. It costs $53 per room per night.
