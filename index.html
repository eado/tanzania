        <h class="bodyheader">Introduction</h>
		<p class="bodyparagraph">Although much of the world is in need of better medical care, Africa needs our help the most. 
			Our trip visits rural Tanzania, where native peoples are facing life-threatening medical challenges. We can help.</p>
        <h class="bodyheader">Why are we Going?</h>
		<p class="bodyparagraph">Residents of Africa, especially native peoples, have very low incomes. This means that, among other issues, they have trouble getting
			good-quality medical care. However, new hospitals and medical buildings are being built to service their needs. 
			These hospitals are short on staff. That's where we come in. Our trip will visit rural Tanzania to work in 
			hospitals. 
			Diseases like malaeria, HIV/AIDS, and others are a major concern. With these new hospitals, we can save the lives of millions.
